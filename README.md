# An-Interactive-model-to-depict-the-Real-Estate-Price-in-India
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project. house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. As continuous house prices, they will be predicted with various regression techniques including Linear regression, and Random Forest regression; as individual price ranges, they will be predicted with different kind of classification methods. We will also perform PCA to improve the prediction accuracy. The goal of this project is to create a regression model and a classification model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.
